# UnixShell
A example/utility of the power of my `UnixAPI` library.
Allow run commands in the host system over WINE.

## First Run:
- In the first run (without the UnixAPI installed) the UnixShell will automatically generate a module to you put in your wine directory
- Keep in mind this will allow any malicious software under WINE call anything in your host system
- With the UnixAPI installed you're ready to use

## Usage:
- Run: `UnixShell.exe notify-send -u low "Hello World"`
- See the magic

## Dependencies:
- [UnixAPI](https://github.com/marcussacana/UnixAPI)
